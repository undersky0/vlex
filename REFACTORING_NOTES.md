# License Assignment Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This refactoring applies SOLID principles and Rails best practices to the license assignment functionality.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **LicenseAssignmentService**: Handles only license assignment/unassignment business logic
- **LicenseAssignmentValidator**: Validates business rules for license assignments
- **LicenseAssignmentQuery**: Handles only data retrieval queries
- **ServiceResult**: Manages operation results and messages
- **Controller**: Only handles HTTP requests/responses and delegates business logic

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Validator can be extended with new validation rules without modifying existing code
- Service classes can be extended with new methods without changing existing functionality

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Service classes follow consistent interfaces that can be substituted
- Result objects provide consistent behavior

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Each service class has focused, minimal interfaces
- No unnecessary dependencies between classes

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Controller depends on service abstractions, not concrete implementations
- Services can be easily tested in isolation

## Rails Best Practices Applied

### Fat Model, Skinny Controller
- Moved business logic from controller to service objects
- Controller only handles HTTP concerns

### Service Objects
- Created focused service classes for complex business operations
- Improved testability and reusability

### Query Objects
- Separated data retrieval logic into dedicated query classes
- Improved maintainability of complex queries

### Strong Parameters
- Added proper parameter filtering with `license_params`
- Improved security and data validation

### Error Handling
- Added proper exception handling in controller
- Graceful error messages for users

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to modify
3. **Reusability**: Service objects can be used from other parts of the application
4. **Readability**: Business logic is clearly organized and documented
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code

## Usage Examples

```ruby
# Assign licenses
result = LicenseAssignmentService.assign_licenses(
  account,
  user_ids: [1, 2],
  product_ids: [3, 4]
)

# Check result
if result.success?
  puts "Assignment successful"
else
  puts result.errors.join(', ')
end

# Get license availability
availability = LicenseAssignmentService.calculate_license_availability(account)
```
